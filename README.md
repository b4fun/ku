Toolkit for collecting and exploring logs using KQL and sqlite.
</h3>

**Ku** (/koÍžo/) collects logs from program output and persists in a sqlite database. It provides a web browser interface for exploring the logs using [KQL][kql].

**Why KQL?** KQL (Kusto Query Language) is a way to explore data with SQL like language. Different than typical SQL syntax, KQL uses ML like syntax, which provides better reading / writing experience. Learn more about [on Microsoft Docs][kql].

**Why sqlite?** Sqlite is a lightweight, self-contained RDBMS with rich features set. It can be used in local and in the cloud. Ku uses sqlite as data backend to archive data persistency and portability.

**Why Ku?** It's a common challenge that querying logs form cloud-native applications in both local and production. One straightforward way is to use tools like `grep` to perform quick searching - however, in most of the cases we need more powerful querying languages to explore the data. Ku aims to fulfill this scenario by brining KQL and sqlite together.

**Project Status** Ku is in a very early stage of development (bugs inside &#8482;). Any contribution is welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
